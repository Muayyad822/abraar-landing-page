            "Attending the Alabraar Arabiyyah class has truly been a beautiful
            journey, Alhamdulillah. The lessons are impactful, the teachers are
            dedicated and intentional, and you can genuinely feel the effort
            they put into making learning smooth and beneficial. One thing I
            deeply appreciate is the ease of catching up on missed classes, it
            makes consistency less stressful. May Allah reward the organizers
            and increase them in goodness."

            "Alhamdulillah Words won't do enough justice to how much impact
            these classes has done to my life. I look forward to every Arabiyyah
            classes because of how much Ustadh Taoheed and Ustadh Kelani
            simplify teaching. They really make learning Arabic easy for me. If
            I could describe Ustadh Abdulmuiz as perfect, I'd. He teaches us so
            well and correct us with lots of compassion. He's the kind of
            teacher who turns the classroom into a safe place and treats his
            students like friends."

            "I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Al Abraarr Academy.
            In the past Ramadan, I would mostly listen to the Quran rather than
            recite it myself due to my inability to do so. But, this Ramadan has
            been awesomely different. The way I now read the Quran amazes me,
            observing the correct Tejweed rules while reading fluently and
            swiftly. Alhamdulillah, I complete each Juz before Asr. The Arabic
            classes have also been really The joy in my heart when I pray behind
            the Imam, understanding the verses of what is being recited, is
            truly beautiful. And to my Ustadh, Ustadh AbdulMuiz,bhe is truly
            what it means to be a true teacher. May Allah honor him and preserve
            him upon goodness. "
